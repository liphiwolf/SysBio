# SysBio
This repo contains the R code and bash scripts used in the practical course "M.Bio.310:Systems Biology".
Most of the code is present in **SystemBiologiePraktikumLionWolf.R**, some of the plotting has been done in separate files not present in this repo. 
For better clarity, the functions used in the project are present in separate files as well.
